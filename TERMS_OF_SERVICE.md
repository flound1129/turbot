# Terms of Service

**Effective date:** February 12, 2026

These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the Turbot Discord bot ("Turbot", "the Bot", "Service"). By interacting with the Bot, you agree to these Terms.

## 1. Description of Service

Turbot is an open-source, self-hosted Discord bot powered by Claude. It provides conversational chat, plugin-based feature generation, and automated code change proposals via pull requests.

## 2. Eligibility

You must comply with Discord's Terms of Service and be permitted to use Discord in your jurisdiction. Server administrators are responsible for ensuring the Bot is configured and used appropriately within their communities.

## 3. Acceptable Use

You agree not to:

- Use the Bot to generate malicious, harmful, or illegal content
- Attempt to exploit the Bot to bypass its security policies or sandboxing mechanisms
- Submit feature requests designed to introduce vulnerabilities, backdoors, or policy-violating code
- Abuse the Bot with excessive requests intended to degrade service for others
- Use the Bot to harass, spam, or harm other users

## 4. Feature Requests and Generated Code

- Feature requests and bot improvements submitted to the Bot may result in pull requests to the associated GitHub repository
- All generated code is subject to review before merge; the Bot does not auto-apply changes
- Generated code is provided "as is" and the operator is responsible for reviewing and approving it
- Submitted feature request descriptions may be logged for administrative purposes

## 5. No Warranty

THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

The Bot depends on third-party services (Discord, Anthropic Claude API, GitHub) which may experience downtime or changes outside our control.

## 6. Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE OPERATORS OF THE BOT SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE.

## 7. Service Availability

The Bot may be unavailable due to maintenance, updates, API outages, or other circumstances. We do not guarantee uptime or uninterrupted service.

## 8. Modifications

We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. Continued use of the Bot after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.

## 9. Termination

Server administrators may remove the Bot at any time. We reserve the right to discontinue the Service or restrict access at our discretion.

## 10. Open Source

Turbot is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0. These Terms govern your use of a running instance of the Bot and do not alter the rights granted under the GPL v3 license for the source code.

## 11. Contact

For questions about these Terms, open an issue on the project's GitHub repository.
